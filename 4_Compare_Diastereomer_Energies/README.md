We aimed to compare the energies of three diastereomers.
Optimization of the all-portrait diastereomer at the GFN2-xTB level was unsuccessful.
Attempts at using geometry constraints still did not produce a feasible geometry.
As a result, only the remaining two diastereomers were included in the energy comparison.
